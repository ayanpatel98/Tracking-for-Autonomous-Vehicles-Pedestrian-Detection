# Pedestrian-Detection-and-Tracking-for-Autonomous-Cars

This project aims to identify and track pedestrians from the eyes of a moving vehicle, which would enable the vehicle to avoid those paths using Histogram of Oriented Gradients for pedestrian detection and Kalman Filter for tracking and prediction.

## What you will need to run this:

* Python 3 
* OpenCV (>3.0.0)
* Video file (for this I used a video called "london_bus.mp4" which is provided in the repo. You can use other videos but make sure you edit the code to change the name or directory)

## How to run:

* Navigate to "pedestrians.py"
* Comment out line 11 if you have OpenCV installed in the same directory as the other packages
* Run using any Python 3 interpreter
